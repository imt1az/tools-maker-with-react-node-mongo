                When we talk about state in our applications, itâ€™s important to be clear about what types of state actually matter.

There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:

Local state
Global state
Server state
URL state

                The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.J

            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?

                    TUnit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.
