# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality
Better Efficiency:
React allows i to keep all app features in its own virtual DOM. All the changes done in DOM are automatically updated.

Web Optimization Friendly:
Using React JS, i can make lightweight web applications. One can run React on the server-side, and the virtual DOM will be delivered.

Component-based Construction:

I can easily make segments per my requirements. It allows me to create my components and integrate them into my core content. React.js updates rapidly and ships well with smooth interface designs.

Better Performance:

Node.js takes the code of JavaScript via Google’s V8 JavaScript engine. The main advantage of this process is that it complies with the JavaScript code directly into the machine code

Freedom:

Node.js offers a lot of freedom when it comes to development. There are generally less constraints with Node.
